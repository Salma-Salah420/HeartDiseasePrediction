Project Description: 
------------------
Our project is about Medical field especially (Heart Disease Detection). The Heart Disease Detection project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on clinical and lifestyle data. The system will help healthcare professionals identify high-risk individuals early, enabling timely intervention and improved patient outcomes.
