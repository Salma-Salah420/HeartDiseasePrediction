Project Description: 
Our project is about Medical field especially (Heart Disease Detection). The Heart Disease Detection project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on clinical and lifestyle data. The system will help healthcare professionals identify high-risk individuals early, enabling timely intervention and improved patient outcomes.

Team Leader: 
Salma Salah Mohamed Mokhtar 

 Objectives: 
•   Build a predictive model for early detection of heart disease.
•   Analyze medical data to identify key risk factors.
•   Create an interactive dashboard for visualizing patient risk levels.
•   Evaluate and deploy the model to ensure accuracy and reliability.


 Tools & Technologies:
•  Programming: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
•  Machine Learning: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
